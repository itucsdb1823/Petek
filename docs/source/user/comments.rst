Comments
===========

Like Grade Distributions, **Comments** are also created, retrieved and deleted
from the detail page of a lecturer. Additionally, notes also contain
comments in their respective pages.

To add a comment click on the note you want to comment in the Notes page
or click on the lecturer you want to comment in the Lecturers Page. In the
detailed view, click on the Add Comment button above.

In the popped up form, type your comment for the Lecturer.

the page.

The red trash icon is for deleting the comment and will appear
only on the comments you make.
