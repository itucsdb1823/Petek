Since our application is a platform for sharing notes, let's start with the
**Notes** tab. When you click the **Notes** tab you first see the 5 most
recently added notes and information about them such as their title and lecturer.
You can use the create note button to create notes.

When you click the button a new page will show up, prompting you to enter
the information for a note.

*Title* is the title of the note and *lecturer* is
the lecturer of the course. The *course id* (ex. ATA) and *code* (ex. 101) can be
selected from the dropdown menus. The *English* check box can be selected if the
course is in English. The *term* of the course is selected and the cloud
storage link (ex. Google Drive or Dropbox link) containing the course note
is entered to the *link* area. The note is submitted with again the Create Note button.
