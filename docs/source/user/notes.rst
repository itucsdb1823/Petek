Notes
========

The **Notes** tab is used for retrieving the notes from the database,
creating notes or updating/deleting your existing notes.
A user can't update/delete another user's note.

When you click the **Notes** tab you first see the 5 most
recently added notes and information about them such as their title and lecturer.
You can use the create note button to create notes.

*Title* is the title of the note and *lecturer* is
the lecturer of the course. The *course id* (ex. ATA) and *code* (ex. 101) can be
selected from the dropdown menus. The *English* check box can be selected if the
course is in English. The *term* of the course is selected and the cloud
storage link (ex. Google Drive or Dropbox link) containing the course note
is entered to the *link* area. The note is submitted with again the Create Note button.

When you click on a note, you will see the comments added to that note and
the cloud link (via Go To Link button) to go to the contents of the note. You can also report the
note to the admins if you think it's not appropriate.
