Lecturers
============

Similar to the **Notes** page, the **Lecturers** page allows the user
to create a lecturer, get a lecturer in the database and update or delete
his/her lecturer. A user can't update/delete another user's lecturer.

The green Add Lecturer button can be used to add a new
lecturer to the database.

      The 5 most recently added lecturers can be seen.

You can also search for a lecturer in the top right search bar.

When you click on a lecturer, you will see the comments and grade
distributions added to that lecturer. Comments are sorted from least to most
recent on the left and the grade distribution images are sorted in the
same way on the right. You can also report the
note to the admins if you think it's not appropriate.
