Lecturers
============

Similar to the **Notes** page, the **Lecturers** page allows the user
to create a lecturer, get a lecturer in the database and update or delete
his/her lecturer. A user can't update/delete another user's lecturer.

The green Add Lecturer button can be used to add a new
lecturer to the database.
