          <p>Welcome to the Petek Project.</p>
          <p>Not Kutusu has been built for ITU students to find the desired course notes easily. Before sharing a course note, you need to fill the inputs such as drive/cloud link, lecturer and course code informations. In that way, another student can search any course note easily by entering its code or lecturer. </p>
          <p>Thank you for using Petek and I look forward to bringing more exciting features in the future.</p>
